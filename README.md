# NotesTool (Django App)
A **website** to add your own notes without limits. This app is initially made to be used by only **one person** (or multiple, if you want), this is because it's **my first app** with Django, but I might commit it in the future and put it (or **you can do it** :) XDDDD, I wanted them to work for it).

The **designs** (logos and css) can be used without any **problem**.
